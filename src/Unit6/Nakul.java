/** QUESTION #1 **/

/**
 * An array of String objects, words, has been properly declared and initialized.
 * Each element of words contains a String consisting of lowercase letters (aâ€“z).
 * Write a code segment that uses an enhanced for loop to print all elements of words that end with "ing".
 * As an example, if words contains {"ten", "fading", "post", "card", "thunder", "hinge", "trailing", "batting"}, then the following output should be produced by the code segment:

 fading
 trailing
 batting

 * Write the code segment as described above. The code segment must use an enhanced for loop to earn full credit. **/
